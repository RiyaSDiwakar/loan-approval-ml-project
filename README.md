# Loan Approval Prediction using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting whether a loan application will be
approved or rejected using machine learning techniques. The prediction
is based on applicant details such as income, credit history, employment
status, loan amount, and other financial attributes.

## Problem Statement
To build a machine learning classification model that can accurately
predict loan approval status using historical loan application data.

## Dataset
The dataset contains information about loan applicants, including:
- Applicant Income
- Coapplicant Income
- Loan Amount
- Loan Amount Term
- Credit History
- Gender
- Marital Status
- Education
- Employment Status
- Loan Status (Approved / Rejected)

## Approach
- Loaded and explored the dataset using Pandas
- Handled missing values and cleaned the data
- Converted categorical variables into numerical form
- Split the data into training and testing sets
- Trained a Random Forest Classifier model
- Evaluated the model using accuracy and classification metrics
- Predicted loan approval for new applicants

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn

## Result
The trained model successfully predicts loan approval status with good
accuracy and demonstrates how machine learning can be applied to
financial decision-making problems.

## Conclusion
This project provides hands-on experience with classification models,
data preprocessing, and evaluation techniques used in real-world fintech
applications.
